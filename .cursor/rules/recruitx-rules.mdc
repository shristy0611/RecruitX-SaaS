## 0. One-Minute Overview

Your daily workflow must balance **state-of-the-art research**, **industrial-strength engineering**, and **strict legal compliance**. That means: read papers before you write code ([researchgate.net][1]), treat every line as potentially user-facing production, test first ([medium.com][2]), version everything (code + data + models) ([medium.com][3]), run CI on every push ([github.blog][4]), document why the model answered the way it did (LIME/SHAP) ([datacamp.com][5]), measure and mitigate hallucination ([arxiv.org][6]), harden privacy under Japan’s APPI ([practiceguides.chambers.com][7]), meter usage cleanly with Stripe ([stripe.com][8]), and audit fairness like the EEOC expects ([eeoc.gov][9]).

## 1. Stay Current — “SOTA or Bust”

| What                        | Rule                                                                                                                                |
| --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Daily Scan**              | Check arXiv’s *cs.CL, cs.LG* RSS and record promising techniques in the team’s **Research Log** before 11 a.m. JST.                 |
| **Critical Reading**        | Summarize *why* a paper beats baselines, its compute cost, and reproducibility flags (e.g., missing seeds) ([researchgate.net][1]). |
| **Spike Prototypes**        | Build a *minimal* Colab/Python proof-of-concept within 24 h; discard if gains < 3 pp over current metric.                           |
| **“No Black-Boxes” Policy** | Prefer algorithms with published internals + explainability hooks; Gemini is **only** for NLG post-processing, never for scoring.   |

---

## 2. Rigorous Experimentation & Reproducibility

### 2.1 Test-Driven Development (TDD)

* Write the failing test **first** for every data transformation, feature extractor, and API route ([medium.com][2]).
* Coverage must remain **≥ 90 %** on `main`; red pipelines block merges.

### 2.2 Version Everything

* **Code** in Git; **data & models** in DVC; tag every experiment with hash + hyper-params ([medium.com][3]).
* Re-run of `dvc repro` must recreate metrics within ±0.1 pp.

### 2.3 Continuous Integration / Delivery

* GitHub Actions workflow: lint → unit tests → integration tests → security scan → Docker build → deploy to staging ([github.blog][4]).
* Upgrade runners to **Node 20** by default ([github.blog][10]).

## 3. Explainability & Fairness

| Area                      | Mandatory Practice                                                                                                   |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Local Explanations**    | Wrap each score with LIME/SHAP attribution; expose top-5 positive & negative features ([datacamp.com][5]).           |
| **Bias Audits**           | Run quarterly adverse-impact analysis; document results and remediation in Bias Audit Report ([eeoc.gov][11]).       |
| **Fairness Benchmarks**   | Track demographic parity & equal opportunity gaps; flag > 5 % disparities for engineering review ([nypost.com][12]). |
| **User-Facing Rationale** | Every report must show “Why we scored X” paragraphs generated via structured template + Gemini summarisation.        |

---

## 4. LLM Safety & Hallucination Control

1. **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** is mandatory for any generated text ([arxiv.org][6]).
2. Follow Google’s **Gemini Safety Playbook**: refusal handling, toxicity checks, jail-break tests ([developers.google.com][13]).
3. Maintain a hallucination evaluation set; target factual error rate < 1 %.

---

## 5. Privacy, Security & Legal

* Collect explicit candidate consent; store timestamp + IP for APPI logs ([practiceguides.chambers.com][7]).
* Encrypt PII at rest with AES-256; rotate keys quarterly.
* Provide “Right to Delete” endpoint returning 204 No Content within 14 days.
* Keep an audit trail for all model decisions; required for future EEOC-style inquiries ([eeoc.gov][14]).

---

## 6. Scalable Data & Retrieval Infrastructure

* Use Pinecone **namespace per tenant** for strict data isolation ([pinecone.io][15]).
* Don’t exceed 40 ms p99 vector search latency; add HNSW parameter tuning PRs as needed.

---

## 7. Billing & Usage Metering

* One “analysis” = 1 CV + 1 JD scored; count via server-side event, send to Stripe metered subscription API ([stripe.com][8]).
* Expose real-time usage in dashboard to maintain transparency (reduces churn).

---

## 8. Code Review, Documentation & Knowledge-Sharing

* Each PR requires **≥ 1** senior approval; use GitHub *IssueOps* templates for check-lists ([github.blog][16]).
* Any public method must carry a **docstring** explaining *why*, not just *what*.
* Update `ARCHITECTURE.md` after merging schema or endpoint changes.

---

### 9. Definition of “Done” Checklist

1. All tests green & coverage ≥ 90 %.
2. CI/CD pipeline passed.
3. Docs & changelog updated.
4. New or updated functionality demoed to QA.
5. APPI & bias audit implications reviewed.

---

## 10. Culture of Continuous Improvement

* Schedule *Weekly Retros* every Friday 16:00 JST to revisit failures & new SOTA findings.
* Celebrate **deleted code**—simplicity is a feature.
* If you’re unsure, **write a test, open a question, or escalate**; silent assumptions cost more than “stupid” questions.
